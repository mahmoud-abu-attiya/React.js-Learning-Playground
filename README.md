# React.js Learning Playground 🚀

This repository is a personal collection of **mini-projects** I built while learning React.js.  
Each folder represents a single topic or feature, implemented using the **latest React version**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS** for styling.

## 📂 Topics

- [Redux Counter](./redux-counter) → A simple counter app using **Redux Toolkit**.
- [Dark Mode with Tailwind](./dark-mode-tailwind) → Light/Dark mode toggle with TailwindCSS.
- [Multi Language App](./multi-language-app) → Multi-language support using **i18next**.
- [Loading State](./loading-state) → Handling loading states in React components.
- (More topics will be added...)
